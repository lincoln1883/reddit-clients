# Reddit client
This React web application uses the Reddit API to allow users to view and search posts and comments provided by the API.\
This project was built to practice working with **React**, **React router** and **Redux**.
## Usage

The starting page shows the popular posts of Reddit. There are also the search bar at the top and the menu with popular subreddits on the right.



## Technologies
During the development of this project these technologies were used:

The library was used for converting some of the comments in Markdown into html.
